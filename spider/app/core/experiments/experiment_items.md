## Things to try out

- [x] Run CPU Intensive task in another Process
- [ ] Run task in the background. (Does asyncio do so without blocking the loop?)
- [ ] Make async task communicate with cpu intensive task.
- [ ] Make a simple task scheduler (pending, running, done) using a sequential data structure. (List, Queue, etc.)
